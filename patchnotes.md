# BEEFSTEW has been updated!

## Beefstew version 1.5 patchnotes:

## Features:
- added a task scheduler / constructor so now bstew can do things on certains dates / times
- /say command
- /bday to tell bstew what your birthday is and u get a present :)
- /sniff ....


## Fixes:
- fixed a bug where messages without attachments werent being picked up by the message event listener
- adding one track to the queue now tells you the track name
- fixed people being able to +2 themselves from other servers

## Misc:
- joke score and nicknames are now tied to specific servers so ppl cant carry over their joker score to a different one, or use their friend Purple to cheat their score higher
- this is part of a big database refactor so its easier to work with and also runs locally instead of being hosted on CCServer which should patch up some more holes there
