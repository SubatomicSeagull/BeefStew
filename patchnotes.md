# BEEFSTEW has been updated!

## Beefstew version 1.5 patchnotes:

## Features:
- /say command
- added a task scheduler / constructor so now bstew can do things on certains dates / times
- added holiday events!
- /bday to tell bstew what your birthday is and u get a present :)
- /sniff ....

## Fixes:
- fixed a bug where messages without attachments werent being picked up by the message event listener
- adding one track to the queue now tells you the track name
- also if there is nothing in the queue but theres a song playing, using /list will still tell you the current track
- fixed people being able to +2 themselves from other servers

## Misc:
- joke score and nicknames are now tied to specific servers so ppl cant carry over their joker score to a different one, or use their friend Purple to cheat their score higher...
- this is part of a big database refactor so its easier to work with and also runs locally instead of being hosted on CCServer which should patch up some more holes there

there are some...interesing...features this time around that ive been thinking about for a while and want to keep a surprise, it could go good or bad but im hoping it will be good! if its too frequent ill just get rid of it lol
