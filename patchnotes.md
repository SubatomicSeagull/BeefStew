# BEEFSTEW has been updated!

## Beefstew version 1.5 patchnotes:

## Features:
- /say command
- added a task scheduler / constructor so now bstew can do things on certains dates / times
- added holiday events!
- /bday to tell bstew what your birthday is and u get a present :)
- /sniff ....
- beefstew will now send funny messages! but only sometimes 
- **Context menus!!!** now if you right click on an image or something you can do stuff!! try it out :)

## Fixes:
- fixed a bug where messages without attachments werent being picked up by the message event listener
- adding one track to the queue now tells you the track name
- also if there is nothing in the queue but theres a song playing, using /list will still tell you the current track
- fixed people being able to +2 themselves from other servers
- message edit and delete will now tell u where it happened

## Misc:
- joke score and nicknames are now tied to specific servers so ppl cant carry over their joker score to a different one, or use their friend Purple to give them points outside of the server theyre in...
- this is part of a big database refactor so its easier to work with and also runs locally instead of being hosted on CCServer which should patch up some more holes there

there are some...interesing...features this time around that ive been thinking about for a while and want to keep a surprise, it could go good or bad but im hoping it will be good! if its too frequent ill just get rid of it lol

also theres two image context menus, the main one that only partners like faceswap and nekotina can use, and the smaller one that non partnered bots have to use so thats why the commands WILL NOT show up if you click the "**Edit Image with Apps** button!!!!!!
