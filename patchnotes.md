# BEEFSTEW has been updated!

## Beefstew version 1.4 patchnotes:

## Features:
- A fully functional music player! (its quite fragile still so please be careful)
- You can now gamble your joker score, please gamble responsibly...

## Fixes:
- A huge refactor implementing command cogs, this makes development a lot easier as now commands are abstracted into classes and a whole lot easier to keep track of
- disallowed the use of commands in DMs, where they wont work
- /ping hosts file is now refreshed every day
- +2 will now save your current nickname as well as just your score
- fixed permissions so now /set_logs cant be used by just anyone
- fixed some spelling errors
- fixed beefstew and other bots not being registered in the joker db properly

## Misc:
- set up an async loop for future commands to be multithreaded which should speed up CPU heavy commands like /ping drastically
- scrapped joke of the week :(
- gave beefstew a new bigger home :)) the Beefstew Integreated Development and Deployment Linux Environment Server. (... or BIDDLES)
- we can now use local files in the embeds by using attachment://

its finally done! the entire reason we thought up this bot in the first place!!! the music player was very hard to make and its still quite unstable so dont get your hopes up too much lol. I have a lot more breathing room on the the biddles machine so i can get more abitious with the features, I want to try and clear the backlog of requests for the next version so it shouldnt take too long as none of them are anywhere near the complexity of the music player,,
